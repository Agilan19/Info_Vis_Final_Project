##### We have chosen to do a problem-driven design study, for which we wish to investigate an ongoing problem which hasnâ€™t been solved in Toronto. The problem we have decided to study is that certain wards in Toronto do not have access to bicycle parking in comparison to others so we would like to do a visualization which can be presented to the City of Toronto highlighting the many wards in Toronto which lack cycling access.

## Instructions for opening visualization (for Windows/Linux users) through Command Terminal:
Download the repository. Extract the zip to your desired folder. Get to \Info_Vis_Final_Project\Bicycle Parking Vis and run the following command:
```python
python3 -m http.server 8080   
```

Then access the page on http://localhost:8080
